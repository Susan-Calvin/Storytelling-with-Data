# Description:
It is decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so with our partners we decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions — will we be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?
A presentation is availiable both - in the repository and in the notebook.
